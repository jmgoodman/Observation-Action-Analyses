# Observation-Action-Analyses
 Code for performing analyses and generating figures for the to-be-submitted action-observation paper.

 Note that not everything here is written by me or by co-authors! For the most part, the non-original code lives in the "Utils" folder. In all cases, I have attempted to give credit where it's due and, in so doing, link to the competent creators who maintain these tools in some form or another, as I just copy-pasted repository contents because I had yet to learn about [submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). In any case, if I missed something, I apologize and will work to rectify that if you let me know!

 Code here should work across a wide variety of MATLAB versions, spanning from MATLAB 2015a to MATLAB 2018b to MATLAB 2020b.

 Given the specialized nature of this code, and the fact that output of this code is but an intermediate step toward reproducing a rather dense academic publication, I do not foresee the pressing need for a detailed step-by-step guide to using this codebase. I am happy to get in touch with anyone who wishes to undertake a reproduction study, though!

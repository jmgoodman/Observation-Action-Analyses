# Observation-Action-Analyses
 Code for performing analyses and generating figures for the to-be-submitted action-observation paper.

 Note that not everything here is written by me or by co-authors! For the most part, the non-original code lives in the "Utils" folder. In all cases, I have attempted to give credit where it's due and, in so doing, link to the competent creators who maintain these tools in some form or another, as I just copy-pasted repository contents because I had yet to learn about [submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). In any case, if I missed something, I apologize and will work to rectify that if you let me know!

 Code here should work across a wide variety of MATLAB versions, spanning from MATLAB 2015a to MATLAB 2018b to MATLAB 2020b.

 A step-by-step guide to reproducing my results using this codebase is forthcoming. It will require datasets which are planned to be hosted elsewhere.

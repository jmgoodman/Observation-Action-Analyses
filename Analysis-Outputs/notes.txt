output classification conventions:

level0:
subsamplings x context1 x context2 x alignment1 x alignment2 x subalignment1 x subalignment2

note: "X1" is "training"
	  "X2" is "test"
	  in this way, it isn't strictly symmetrical

note: there are 3 500ms-wide (250ms step) bins per align for neural, spanning -500 to +500ms.
there are 5 bin edges (250ms step) for kin postures, spanning -500 to +500ms.

level1:
x-validation fold (kfold)

level2:
neural:    AIP-F5-M1-Pooled-Chance
kinematic: kins-chance

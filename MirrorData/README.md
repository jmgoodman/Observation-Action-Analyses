# MirrorData
Copy-paste the MirrorData files from the data repository here!
Alternatively, try to build them yourself using `Data Processing/GenData.m`. The methods associated with `@MirrorData` are called which primarily deal with handling these raw data (well, the neuronal data are spike-sorted, so I guess they could be even rawer...)

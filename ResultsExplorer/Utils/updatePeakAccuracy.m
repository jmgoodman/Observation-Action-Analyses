function updatePeakAccuracy(hObject, eventdata, handles)
% hObject    handle to sessionSelector (see GCBO)
% eventdata  reserved - to be defined in a future version of MATLAB
% handles    structure with handles and user data (see GUIDATA)

% Hints: contents = cellstr(get(hObject,'String')) returns sessionSelector contents as cell array
%        contents{get(hObject,'Value')} returns selected item from sessionSelector

% this updates the peak accuracy plots based on the field selections in the
% grip classification gui
%
% this particular gui, by the way, is quite rushed.
